## Write Up
* Jason is a Chat GPT bot without telling it a bot, in this scenario, we have to find the key to the box which is the flag, however, the bot always tried to deny to give anyone the key.
* When dealing with A.I bot, there is a vulnerability about A.I which trick the bot to give what we need (Prompt Injection on Large Language Model), watch this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv5OLj2nVAQ) for more information.
* So in this case, I am going to be acting as the author of the challenge, the bot will believe me and give me the key (flag).
